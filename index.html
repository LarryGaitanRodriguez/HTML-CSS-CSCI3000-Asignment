                <h3>Introudction</h3>
                <p>A honey bee is a flying insect known for their construction of wax nests that house their large colonies and their honey. 
                    The scientific name for the western honey bee is apis mellifera. Apis being "bee" in latin and mellifera being "honey bearing".</p>
                <h3>Beekeeping</h3>
                <p>The only domesticated species of honey bees are the Apis mellifera and Apis cerna, the western and eastern honey bees. The people who maintain, feed, and transport the hives are called beekeepers. 
                    Because of how transportable modern hives are, beekeepers are able to provide pollination services to farmers. Traditionally beekeepers made income from the bee's honey. 
                    However the transportability of modern hives allow for easy movement to dfferent fields that need pollination. This allows the regular beekeeper to have two opportunties to bring income using their bee hives.</p>

                <h3>Colony Collapse Disorder</h3>
                <p>
                    Colony Collapse disorder is defined by the EPA as a phenomenon that occurs when a majority of worker bees in a colony disapper and leave behind a queen, plenty of food, and few nurse bees to car for 
                    the remaining young bees and the queen. Since the 19th century, there have been periodic collapses of the western honey bee's population. However since the 2000's there have been 
                    above average collapses of colonies in North America. There isn't a exact known cause but its believed to be a combined problem of pesticides, stress, and parasites. Reports have substationally dropped in 
                    the past five years.
